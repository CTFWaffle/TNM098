Using just the credit and loyalty card data, identify the most popular locations, and when they are popular.
What anomalies do you see? What corrections would you recommend to correct these anomalies?
Answer:

Katerina's caffe, Hippokampos, Brew've been served and Guy's Gyros are the most popular locations, where Katerina's cafe is 
the most popular location. The largest difference in creditcard transactions versus loyality card transactions are also at 
Katerina's cafe and Brew've been served. Katerina's cafe is the only cafe that stays open during weekends where it gets 
the same traffic as usual. Saturdays, the number of transactions is the largest out of all locations, 
which is extra suspicious because all other caffes are closed. In general there are fewer transactions during weekends,
however, some places get more traffic during weekends, an example of this is the Golf Course.

Add the vehicle data to your analysis of the credit and loyalty card data. How does your assessment of the anomalies in question 1 change based on this new data? 
What discrepancies between vehicle, credit, and loyalty card data do you find?
Answer: The main anomalies are that there are transactions at places where people have 0 visits. See graph -_-

Can you infer the owners of each credit card and loyalty card? What is your evidence? Where are there uncertainties in your method? 
Where are there uncertainties in the data?
Answer: Yes

Given the data sources provided, identify potential informal or unofficial relationships among GASTech personnel. Provide evidence for these relationships.

Do you see evidence of suspicious activity? Identify 1- 10 locations where you believe the suspicious activity is occurring, and why
Answer: Bertrand doing something suspicious, why is he out at the scrap yard past midnight??


# Example code approach
# 1. Load all datasets
# 2. For each credit card transaction:
#    - Find GPS records at same timestamp and location
#    - Link to employee through car assignment
# 3. Repeat for loyalty card data
# 4. Build profiles of each employee's movement and spending
